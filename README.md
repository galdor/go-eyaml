# go-eyaml
## Introduction
The go-eyaml module —the "e" standing for "extended"— is a small set of
utilities to remediate to some of the shortcoming of the well known
[gopkg.in/yaml.v3](https://github.com/go-yaml/yaml).

While I intend to write a [YAML parser](https://github.com/galdor/go-yaml), the
amount of work is considerable due to YAML being batshit crazy. In the mean
time, this module is a way to avoid copying the same functions everywhere.

## Usage
Refer to the [Go package documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/go.n16f.net/eyaml)
for information about the API.

## Licensing
Go-eyaml is open source software distributed under the
